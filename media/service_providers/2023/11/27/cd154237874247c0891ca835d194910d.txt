TLS certificate used to secure and identify our website as legitimate.
what TLS certificate does is to tie our organization's cryptographic key 
to our brand so no one else can use it.
TLS is crucial element of having a secure website and TLS makes the HTTPS apper
at the begging of the URL.
when users connect with websites that use TLS certificates (which enables HTTPS),
their information is encrypted, meaning that itâ€™s no longer readable and appears
like gibberish to anyone who tries to intercept it.
if we don't use TLS, so many risks will happen like: data leaks, attacks and 
for sure our site will be distrusted by browsers

when you don't have a SSL certificate:
- our website appear as "Not Secure" in the address bar
- all of the major browsers will not trust our site
- our site search ranking will plummet on Google
- we will face real problems when working with payments platforms
- attackerss will have an open field to attack our website and steal customers 
  personal data.
- lose data encryption: TLS encrypt the data transmitted between a user's browser
  and the server, encryption ensures that sensitive data remains secure and cannot
  be intercepted by attackers.
