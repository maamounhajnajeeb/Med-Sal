payment requirements
----------------------

- first step: we need to integrate payment gateway(such as stripe)
  with our backend, then we will work with payment gateway throw APIs that offered
  by the gateway

- second step: merchant account, we need a merchant account with the chosen payment
  gateway, this account will allow us to recieve payments and manage transiction.

- third step: our backend server should have an TLS certificate installed, TLS
  encrypts sensitive data during transmission.

- fourth step: we must comply with payment card industry data security standarad
  (PCI DSS) requirements for securely stroring and transmitting payment and card
  data, this may invlove following certain encryption and data handling practices.
  
  what is (PCI DSS)?
  payment card industry data security standarad

  it consists of 12 requirements that cover various aspects of information 
  security, including: network security, physical security, access control, testing
  networks and regular monitoring
  
  to achieve compliance with (PCI DSS) we must undergo regular assessments and audits
  , conducted by internal or external qualified security assessors (QSA), these
  assessments evaluate wether our system effecively meet the requirements of the
  standard (PCI DSS)

- fifth step: Authentication and Authorization: we need to implement proper 
  authentication & authorization system can make payments action

- sixth step: handling payments errors, we need an error handling mechanism to
  handle payment failures or errors gracefully

- seventh step: implement transictional logging to keep a record of all payement
  related actions for future reference.
